    "Short for _stacked generalization_, it's idea is fairly simple. Insead of using trivial functions(such as hard voting) to aggregate the predictions of the predictors in an ensemble why don't we train a model to perform this aggregation!!! The final predictor(called a _blender_ or _meta learner_) takes the predictions as inputs and makes a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a blender, a common approach is to use a hold-out set. First you split a training set into two subsets. The first subset is used to train the predictors on the first layer. Next the first layer predictors made predictions on the second set. We can create a new training set useing thes input values as features. The blender is trained on this so it learns to predict the target value givent the first layer's predictions.\n",
